# Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists 
# intersect. Return the interÂ­ secting node. Note that the 
# intersection is defined based on reference, not value.
# That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is the exact 
# same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked list, 
# then they are intersecting.


# time complexity: O(n+m)
# space complexity: O(1)
